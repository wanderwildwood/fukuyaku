/**
 * DuraSpeed, MediaTek's background manager on the Kompakt, force-stops installed apps a few
 * minutes after the screen goes dark, and a force-stop cancels every alarm an app has set:
 * the reminders do not ring, and nothing starts the app again until somebody opens it. Apps
 * switched on in its list are left alone, but that list cannot be read by another app, and
 * Settings has no way into it. Its App info page can be opened, and has an Open button, so
 * that is where the button goes; whether it was done is the person's word.
 *
 * A stop by the system takes that word back: DuraSpeed does not stop apps on its list.
 * Android records such a stop as "stop <package> due to from pid N". A Force stop pressed by
 * hand in Settings reads the same, and is the one case this gets wrong.
